# Getting Started with the application
ðŸ“ŒLink for project - https://ashutosh-pennypot-assignment.vercel.app <br/>
This project is a frontend demonstration of a sample blog app given as an assignment. The project uses techstack like HTML, CSS, JS(React). It also implements markdown parser to convert Markdown to regular HTML. I have used react-router-dom for routing through the application. <br/>

# Home Section (/)
The home page consists of content provided in the figma design doc. It consists of the exact replica of the figma design provided. I used Swipper for implementing the swipe feature on the home page. It is present in the code but due to lack of content(backend) i have disabled it. To show the write section i have added write button at the top in order to navigate ton write section. The footer section consists of working link for contact page. <br/>

# Write Section ( /write )
The project contains a write section (button in navbar) where you can write a new blog. I have implemented markdown parser here. The markdown parser along with markdown editor is implemented. It also contains buttons with having bold, italic and newline feature. <br/>
User also has option to upload image along with the text content after choosing category(tag) of the blog. <br/>

# Contact Section (/contact)
This section consists of contact page. I tried to match the UI design that was provided to me. The details filled will be sent to a whatsapp number (8087572655). Just an additional functionality i added for fun. <br/>

# Techstack used 
HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS(CSS Framework), Javascript, Framework- React <br/>
Imp React Libraries used - React-icons, react-router-dom, react-markdown

# Difficulties faced 
Since direct links of figma design was not provided, i was unable to extract the logos and other images from the sample design. I was also unable to detect the font style due to the same issue. <br/>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
