# Getting Started with the application
ðŸ“ŒLink for project - https://ashutosh-pennypot-assignment.vercel.app <br/>
<br/>
This project is a frontend demonstration of a sample blog app given as an assignment. The project uses techstack like HTML, CSS, JS(React). It also implements markdown parser to convert Markdown to regular HTML. I have used react-router-dom for routing through the application. <br/>

# Home Section (/)
ðŸŽ¯The home page consists of content provided in the figma design doc. It consists of the exact replica of the figma design provided. I used Swipper for implementing the swipe feature on the home page. It is present in the code but due to lack of content(backend) i have disabled it. To show the write section i have added write button at the top in order to navigate ton write section. The footer section consists of working link for contact page. <br/>

# Write Section ( /write )
ðŸŽ¯The project contains a write section (button in navbar) where you can write a new blog. I have implemented markdown parser here. The markdown parser along with markdown editor is implemented. It also contains buttons with having bold, italic and newline feature. <br/>
User also has option to upload image along with the text content after choosing category(tag) of the blog. <br/>

# Contact Section (/contact)
ðŸŽ¯This section consists of contact page. I tried to match the UI design that was provided to me. The details filled will be sent to a whatsapp number (8087572655). Just an additional functionality i added for fun ðŸ˜‰. <br/>

# Techstack used 
ðŸŽ¯HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS(CSS Framework), Javascript, Framework- React <br/>
ðŸŽ¯Imp React Libraries used - React-icons, react-router-dom, react-markdown

# Difficulties faced 
ðŸŽ¯Since direct links of figma design was not provided, i was unable to extract the logos and other images from the sample design. I was also unable to detect the font style due to the same issue. <br/>
